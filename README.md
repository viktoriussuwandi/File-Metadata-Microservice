###  Some of additional features :
      * Avoid duplicate username
      * Avoid duplicate user_id using recursive function
      * Using local file to save user input
      * Using id generator to generate user id
      * Using express validator to validate user input


### Test Scenario :
- You should provide your own project, not the example URL.
- You can submit a `form` that includes a `file upload`.
- The form file input field has the `name` attribute set to `upfile`.
- When you submit a `file`, you receive the `file name`, `type`, and `size` in `bytes` within the `JSON` response.
